                    <p>My name is Olga Da Silva. I am a 18 year old Student born in Sao Tome, raised in Portugal. My goal in life is to become a creative stylist or officially own a streetwear brand called GOALZ. The word 
                        "GOALZ" was made using my own name Olga and the last letter of my middle name "Cruz". But that is not all, I want people to see Goalz as a brand that they can find their iconic style despite the focus on
                        streetwear. I want you as my client to feel your best at all times that is what GOALZ is all about.

                <p>3048 - Into the future, is based on a college project themed Juxtaposition; Dystopia Vs Utopia. This was my last project of the year and was the toughest of them all. Creating a garment from scratch is hard but you have to stay resilient when things don't go your way for the first time just keep trying and trying. This project to me was all about seeing this world and wondering about its future, reasoning of the number 3048. I chose that year because I knew it was far enough for this generation to wonder how our planet will turn out; chaotic or all in harmony? The materials and colours chosen for this garment were all on purpose, the black and the purple represent chaos and the white represents peace but if you see the purple fabric has naturally flow this shows the world flowing peacefully one day. Overall, making this garment was 100% a journey for me.</p>

                <p>Make an Impact was an athleisure based project and I made this garment thinking about the plus size females that want to feel confident but cozy at the same time. So I designed a built-in corset for this dress to cinch the areas that plus sized women feel uncomfortable with. The garment was a plain black hooded dress with purple hems and lacing. This was my first time making my first pattern. It was difficult, yes but in the end with all the help I needed I started to understand garment construction. What I would do better with this garment is remove the monster high logo as it wasn't needed but at the time I felt that I was experimenting many things so curiosity got the best of me.</p>

                <p>Sustainability was my first college project and was my favourite project. For this project I made patchwork jeans and they could also make into shorts if removed all the safety pins. Patchwork is a very repetitive process and you need patience for it but once it is finished it creates a masterpiece. This was a fun project because you could only use what was around you, you couldn't buy any new fabric, you just had to use random pieces of fabric you found in the classroom or whatever you had at home that you didn't need. Iused mostly just different denims in all different colours to make my patchwork legs. </p>
